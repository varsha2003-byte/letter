    <h1>Re:Fathimas Application for PhD</h1>

    <p>Dear <strong>Fathima</strong>,</p>

    <p>Thanyou for your recent application to join us at the University of Auckland's science faculty to study as part pf your <abbr title="Doctor of Philosophy">PhD</abbr> next year. The following are the key dates for your reference:</p>

    <h2>Starting dates</h2>
    <p>We are happy to accommodate you starting your study with us at any time ,however it would suit us better if you could start at the beginning of a semester; the start date for each one are as follows:</p>   <ul>
        <li><time datetime="2024-08-15"><strong>1st sem:</strong>August 15, 2024</time></li>
        <li><time datetime="2024-09-01"><strong>2nd sem:</strong>September 1, 2024</time></li>
        <li><time datetime="2024-10-01"><strong>3srd sem:</strong>October 1, 2024</time></li>
    </ul>
<p>Please let me know if this is okay,and if so which start date you would prefer</p>
<p>You can find more information about <a href="#">important university dates</a>on our website</p>
    <h2>Study Subjects</h2>
    <p>The program includes a comprehensive curriculum covering the following subjects:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Data Structures and Algorithms</li>
        <li>Advanced <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> and <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr></li>
        <li>Machine Learning</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The Auckland Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded research facility — as long as the subjects fall
            somewhere in the realm of science and technology. You seem like an intelligent, dedicated researcher, and
            just the kind of person we'd like to have on our team. Saying that, of the ideas you submitted we were most
            intrigued by are as follows, in order of priority:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Turning H2O into wine, and the health benefits of Resveratrol
                (C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.) </li>
            <li>Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplayers at temperatures exceeding 30°C (86°F), when the
                audience size exponentially increases (effect of 3 × 10<sup>3</sup> increasing to 3 × 10<sup>4</sup>.)
            </li>
            <li><abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> and <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>
                constructs for representing musical scores.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects, including how long you'd expect the
            research to take, required staff and other resources, and anything else you think we'd need to know? Thanks.
        </p>
        <h2>Exotic dance moves</h2>
        <p>Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work, I <em>did</em> study exotic tribal dances. To answer
            your question, my favourite dances are as follows, with definitions:
        </p>
        <dl>
        <dt>Polynesian chicken dance</dt>
        <dd>A little known but <em>very</em> influential dance dating back as far as 300<abbr
                title="Before christ">BC</abbr>, a whole village would dance
            around in a circle like chickens, to encourage their livestock to be "fruitful".</dd>
        <dt>Icelandic brownian shuffle</dt>
        <dd>Before the Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm, they used to practice this dance, which
            involved huddling close together in a circle on the floor, and shuffling their bodies around in
            imperceptibly tiny, very rapid movements. One of my fellow students used to say that he thought this dance
            inspired modern styles such as Twerking.
        </dd>
        <dt>Arctic robot dance</dt>
        <dd>An interesting example of historic misinformation, English explorers in the 1960s believed to have
            discovered a new dance style characterized by "robotic", stilted movements, being practiced by inhabitants
            of Northern Alaska and Canada. Later on however it was discovered that they were just moving like this
            because they were really cold.
